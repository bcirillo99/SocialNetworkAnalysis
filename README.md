# SocialNetworkAnalysis

## Task1: Social Network Mining
Implement, if necessary, optimized versions of the social network mining algorithms seen during the course (diameter, triangles computation, clustering) 

## Task2: Centrality Measures
Implement the shapley-closeness centrality measure as defined in Michalack et al. (JAIR 2013) sec. 4.4.
Implement, if necessary, optimized versions of all studied centrality measures (degree, closeness, betweenness, PageRank, HITS-authority, HITS-hubiness, HITS-both, voterank, shapley-degree, shapley-threshold, shapley-closeness)
